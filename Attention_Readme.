Analysis: 
1. Data was divide in two parts based on attention category: i)divided ii)focused
2. Levenes Test was conducted to understand if the variance was normal
3. A variable 'diff' was created to find the difference between the scores for those between focused and divided attention.
4. The diff was passed through a Shapiro Test to understand if the data accepted Normal Distribution.
5. 2sample test was conducted between the scores of Focused and divided attention based students.

Conclusion:
1. In the Levenes test, the variance was proved to be normal as pvalue was 51%.
2. In the Shapero Test, the data followed normal distribution as pvalue as 17%.
3. Finally in the 2 sample test, since P value was 1.77, we could safely conclude that focused attention does lead to better Test scores.
